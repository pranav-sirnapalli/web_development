React essentials section4:

** Wrappers in JSX:
- Every JSX code needs a wrapper that is why in below code <div> tag is required

return(
   <div>
	<Header/>
	<main>
	</main>
   </div>
)

- If you remove above <div> it will give an error as it needs to be wrapped in single tag in JSX.

* You can use fragment instead of div so that you don't include an additional tag in code:

Syntax code Ex by replacing div with fragment:

import { useState, Fragment } from 'react';

return(
	<Fragment>
		<Header/>
		<main>
		</main>
	</Fragment>
);

* However, in new project you don't need to import and use it just empty tags would be enough

Sample Code:

return(
	<>
		<Header/>
		<main>
		</main>
	</>
);
