- Tags provide content structure, not layout or style

- Paragraph tag <p>
<p> hello world</p>

- The style attribute
<p style="color:red;"> This is a red paragraph.</p>

- Headings
<h1> Main heading </h1>
<h2> Second heading </h2>
<h6> Smallest heading </h6>
Headings with style:
<h1 style="font-size:60px;"> Heading 1 </h1>

<h1> defines the most important heading.
<h6> defines the least important heading.

- Images
<img src="dog.png" alt="dog"/>
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

src: Holds the url of where the image is
alt: Incase image is not shown, what to show
width: Width of image to display
Height: Height of image to display

The url used for src and alt can be of two types:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. 
Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.
