In body part of our HTML Skeleton, it consists of 3 parts:

- Multiple components can be added to the body: text in form of paragraph,
  Images and Videos, Buttons and Forms.

   <header>
	<h1> This is the head of the body </h1>
   </header>

   <main>
	<h2> This is the torso </h2>
   </main>

   <footer>
 	<p>  These are the feet </p>
   </footer>
</body>

HTML Headings:

<h1> is the largest heading size.
<h6> is the smallest heading size.

Paragraph Tag:
<p> </p>
Mulitple ssentences can be typed between opening and closing paragraph tags

To separate paragraphs and add a space between then - we use something called a 'break' tag <br>.
Interestingly, <br> does NOT need a closing tag.
