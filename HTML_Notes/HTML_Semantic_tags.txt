Semantic HTML: - It clearly describes the content of the page.
	       - HTML loses its semantic when tags are misused or generic tags are
		 overused instead of semantic tags.

Semantic HTML includes the usage of semantic grouping tags, which give meaning to different
sections of the page. These are some of the most commonly used ones:

1. <article> : self contained, independently distributable content.
2. <section> : Thematic grouping of content, not self contained.
3. <header>  : Introductory content
4. <main>    : Main content, only one per page
5. <nav>     : Section of links to navigate to a certain part
6. <aside>   : Used for contents indirectly related to content, basically non-vital info
7. <footer>  : Copy right info, etc
